fig 1 :

- A1, A2 + plot_both [BAR SN]



fig2 = le reste + doubler C (collinéaire et cross version 1)

nomenclature : 

​	'iso' = collinéaire sur toute la ligne (incluant le champs récepteur) base = static

​	'cross' cg gabor = iso + cross (ref = motion axis)



fig7:

- radial + cardinal  + 2stroke avec phase (fig7)

- \+ pointillé représentant bar + SN



fig1 trop de répétitions

- zoom ? passer de 5 à 3 gabors ?



champs récepteurs:

- deux trois exemples

- calculs d'overlap ?

## Figure 1: Latency basins + Protocols

Font for Sector and Full should be smaller than A,B, C, D

The cardinal axis should appear in dotted in Panel C. They are missing.

I would suggest to have a symbol representing the preferred orientation of the RF

A : two top graphs are the same cell, I suppose. So regroup them in A1

A: The top left figure should be A2

B: expand on the column width

 

 

## Figure 2: Single Cell (A) and Average (B)

May be ass labels “Single Cell” and “Population (n=x)”

White arrows should be superimposed in A with the RF insert (as shown in B) .

In B:

The two schematized protocols should be in inset with the right label 

Discuss which label to use to avoid the ambiguity (ISO-ORIENTED, CROSS-ORIENTED).

The color code will be lost for the cross-oriented protocol

 

## Figure 3: Centripetal/Centrifugal single cell example

The thickness of the font and traces is too large.

Do something more comparable visually with the other figures

Use a color slightly darker for the traces and the histogram borders than the fill color.

## Figure 7: Causal relationship between FF/Horizontal Input Phase and the Spiking Latency change

- [ ] Modify the labels (after discussion)

- [x] Modify speed scale: “m/s” replace by “ms/mm”

  ?  -> mm/ms

- [x] Nb of measures (capitals are at the wrong place)

- [x] Nb of cells

- [x] Radial AM (OK)

- [x] Cardinal AM (OK)

- [x] 2-stroke AM

- [x] 2-stroke

- [x] virer AM et add nb of cells in the label

- [x] Bar (OK)

- [x] SN (rather than impulse)

- [ ] A: Left column panels

- [ ] B : Input Phase Distribution

- [ ] C: Causal relation between Spiking Latency advance (DL ) and Vm Phase between FF/Horizontal Input

- [x] Replace “Impact of temporal phase” by “Impact of the Phase between FF/Horizontal Inputs”

- [x] Replace “Spiking relative latency” by “Spiking Latency Advance (DL )” as used elsewhere in the text

- [x] Replace “Vm relative latency” by “FF/Horizontal Input Phase”

- [x] Add “Horizontal Advance” on the left side, and “Horizonal Lag” on the right side of the bottom abscissa axis.

- [x] x_axis : FF à zero

- [x] reverse + et -

- [ ] ordonnée delta L

## Figure 8:

- [ ] Redo: The fonts of the lower panel have not the same graphic definition as those of the upper panel

  -> drawing

## Figure 9:

- [x] May be add “Single Cell” and “Population Average” labels at the top of the two columns

 

## Figure 10:

- [x] Surround-Then-Center
- [x] “Surround-Then-Center” *Minus* “Center-Only”
- [x] to be checked
