to update the data to be used
idea : 
- move the old files on git -> old folder
- append the new data in the owncloud/data/new

step to follow:
1- move the old data
2- append the new files in owncloud/data/new
3- step by step (though python testing process)
reorder the data in the code and owncloud folder
